{"name":"Libxfce4ui","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.xfce.org/xfce/libxfce4ui","body":"What is it?\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is libxfce4ui, the replacement of the old libxfcegui4 library. It is used\r\nto share commonly used Xfce widgets amoung the Xfce applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired packages\r\n=================\r\n\r\nLibxfce4ui depends on the following packages:\r\n\r\n - GTK+ 2.10.0 or above\r\n - GLib 2.12.0 or above\r\n - Libxfce4util 4.4.0 or above\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebugging Support\r\n=================\r\n\r\nLibxfce4ui currently supports four different levels of debugging support, which\r\ncan be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output of\r\n`configure --help'):\r\n\r\n  `full'\tUse this if you want to debug libxfce4ui to locate a bug. The\r\n  \t\tbuild will most probably be noticably slower. This is also\r\n\t\trecommended for people that want to develop Xfce applications.\r\n\r\n  `yes'\t\tThis is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all\r\n  \t\tkinds of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run\r\n\t\tslower. Use this if you want to develop for Xfce.\r\n\r\n  `minimum'\tThis is the default for release builds, and presents the\r\n  \t\trecommended behaviour.\r\n\r\n  `no'\t\tDisables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know\r\n  \t\texactly what you do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs?\r\n===================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system\r\n(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Libxfce4ui). You will need to\r\ncreate an account for yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease read the HACKING file for information on where to send\r\nchanges or bugfixes for this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
