4.7.0
=====
Initial version of the library. The intention of this new library is a
cleanup of the old libxfcegui4 library to remove the deprecated code
and get rid of netk (since 4.6 we use libwnck for that).

Biggest changes compared to libxfcegui4:
- New session manager client.
- Improved code for spawing applications.
- New dialog functions.
- Support for glade-3's GtkBuilder implementation.
